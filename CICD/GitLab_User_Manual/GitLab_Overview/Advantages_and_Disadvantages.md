# 1.2. Advantages and disadvantages of GitLab.  

## \* Advantages 

GitLab provides GitLab Community Edition version for users to locate, on which servers their code is present. 

GitLab provides an unlimited number of private and public repositories for free. 

The Snippet section can share a small amount of code from a project, instead of sharing the whole project. 

## \* Disadvantages 

While pushing and pulling repositories, it is not as fast as GitHub. 

GitLab interface will take time while switching from one page to another.
