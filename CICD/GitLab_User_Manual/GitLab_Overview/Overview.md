# GitLab introduction 

## 1. Overview 

Before we dive into definition for Gitlab, first we need to understand a few terminologies. We often come across these terms like Git, Gitlab, GitHub, and Bitbucket. Let's see definition of all these as below âˆ’ 

Git - It is a source code versioning system that lets you locally track changes and push or pull changes from remote resources. 

GitLab, GitHub, and Bitbucket - Are services that provide remote access to Git repositories. In addition to hosting your code, the services provide additional features designed to help manage the software development lifecycle. These additional features include managing the sharing of code between different people, bug tracking, wiki space and other tools for 'social coding'. 

GitHub is a publicly available, free service which requires all code (unless you have a paid account) to be opened. Anyone can see the code you push to GitHub and offer suggestions for improvement. GitHub currently hosts the source code for tens of thousands of open-source projects. 

GitLab is a GitHub like service that organizations can use to provide internal management of git repositories. It is a self-hosted Git-repository management system that keeps the user code private and can easily deploy the changes of the code. 

## \* Why do we use GitLab?  

GitLab is a great way to manage git repositories on centralized server. GitLab gives you complete control over your repositories or projects and allows you to decide whether they are public or private for free.
