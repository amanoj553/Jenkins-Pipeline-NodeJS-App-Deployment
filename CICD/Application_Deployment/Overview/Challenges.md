## 4. Challenges 

This challenge is composed of 4 parts: GitHub Repos, build docker image, container creation and run test cases through CI/CD. 

- First, we collect server application source code information and get the Source code Repositories (GitHub). 

- As a second step, install and configure Jenkins. 

Make sure SSH connection between CI-CD and WebApp server. 

- Third, create a CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins to build and run Acceptance test cases. 

- Lastly, to complete deployment, Deploy application as a container.
